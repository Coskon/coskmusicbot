## Recently added
- Added `share`, `sharecomp` and `load` modes to the `playlist` command: Now you can share custom playlists between servers, to get a share code you use `playlist share [playlist name]` or `playlist sharecomp [playlist name]`, and load it using `playlist load [code]`, the difference between `share` and `sharecomp` is that the first method requires both servers to have the bot hosted by the same person because it grabs the data directly from the .json files, the second method gives a base85 encoded version of each url so it should be always compatible (or, if all urls are youtube videos, it gives a string with all video ids concatenated), however the length of the code is very long in this case, luckily you can just download the .txt file it provides and attach it when loading the playlist instead of writing the share code in the command.
- Added parameter `DISCONNECT_AFTER_QUEUE_END` to indicate if the bot should stay or not when all songs have ended, its `False` by default so the bot stays. This is useful if you plan on playing more songs and are bothered by the bot disconnecting and connecting each time. The queue will not clear with this parameter set to `False`, if you want to clear the queue for now you will need to call the `leave` command (a `clear` command might be added).
- Changed parameter `SKIP_PRIVATE_SEARCH` to `True` by default. When searching on YouTube with this option enabled, it will be faster but it will not include age restricted videos or livestreams. If you plan on searching for any of these instead of going to YouTube and getting the url then disable this option, however you should probably set the `MAX_SEARCH_SELECT` parameter to a lower value to improve speeds.
- New command: `playlist [mode] [name] [query]`, allows users to manage custom playlists (not shared between servers). Use `playlist create [name]` to create a playlist, `playlist add name [song]` to add songs to a playlist or `playlist addqueue name` to add the current queue, and `playlist play name` to add the playlist to the queue. By default, `favs` is created. To see the current playlists created, use `playlist names`, to see the songs on a playlist use `playlist list name`.
- Improved raw audio read, now less audios should need the `-opt force` option.
- `PLAYLIST_MAX_TIME` no longer exists, now the duration of all playlists is calculated due to a speed increase by using yt-dlp, it shouldn't take more than a few seconds for very long playlists (+1000 videos).
- Added NÂ° of videos and queue length into the queue, and now it also loads `QUEUE_VIDEOS_PER_PAGE` (30 by default) videos instead of the full queue at once, improving speeds for long queues.
- New command: `reload`, reloads the values of the parameters from the PARAMETERS.txt file without having to restart the bot. Only admins can do this (no individual user permission for this).

## Installation Guide
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Clone or [download](https://github.com/Coskon/coskmusicbot/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the repository.
- Create a [Discord Application](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started). It should have at least [these](https://imgur.com/a/FIytxLn) permissions (integer representation: 36711488), though this might change for future features.
- Put your discord api key (and any other of the optional api keys) on the `API_KEYS.txt` file.
- Run the `run.bat` script to initialize the bot (or `run_beta.bat` to run the beta).
- **(If `run.bat` didn't work)** Open a CMD on the project folder and input the following commands (windows):
    ```console
    python.exe -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    lang/lang.py
    bot.py
    ```
- **(Optional)** Run `gradio_ui.bat` to initialize the user interface to modify some options and parameters, or change them in `PARAMETERS.txt`.

### Guide for cloud services
If you don't want to have your computer running the bot or you want/need for it to be always active, you may need to use a cloud service.
I found "Replit" as a free alternative (you can go [here](https://replit.com/@mcgamescompany/Cosk-Music-Bot?v=1#main.py) and press "Use Template"), so i'll use that as the base, but following the general guide should work.
- Go to your chosen service and create a project. For Replit, select the "python discord bot" template.
- Upload the files; `bot.py` (you may rename it to `main.py` if necessary, as it is the case for Replit), `lang.py` in the folder `lang`, `extras.py`, `utilidades.py` and optionally other files.
- Set the secrets/enviroment variables (recommended for security reasons): `DISCORD_APP_KEY`, optionally; `TENOR_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_KEY`, `GENIUS_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `SPOTIFY_ID`, `SPOTIFY_SECRET`. Alternatively, you may set them in the `API_KEYS.txt` file, however this is not recommended, given that is a public site (specially in Replit, where the code is public for the free plan), using enviroment variables is better (and often easier) in this case.
- If you used enviroment variables, change `USE_PRIVATE_TOKENS` to `True` in both `bot.py` and `utilidades.py` (you can find it normally with Ctrl+F or with some search function your platform probably has).
- Before running the main file, find a way to run `lang.py`. In Replit, you can go to the "Shell" section, and run `python lang/lang.py`. This is only needed once for each time `lang.py` is changed.
- **Important:** Make sure your platform has FFMPEG and OPUS support. In Replit, you have to go to `replit.nix` (it's a hidden file), and add `pkgs.libopus` to  `deps = [ ... ]`.
- If the program doesn't automatically install/import the required packages, you may add the `requirements.txt` file and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the shell.
- Done! For Replit, you can just press "Run" (make sure `bot.py` is renamed to `main.py`) to run your bot.

## Important
- This script was only tested on WINDOWS, it might not work on other OS.
- If you were to delete all prefixes and don't want to mess with the .json files to add them back, simply use "DEF_PREFIX" as the prefix and call the `options default` or `add_prefix [prefix]` commands.

## Limitations
- Some commands will not work if the necessary API key is not provided or is incorrect.
- Bot language is global for all servers (cannot changed individually for each server). This will probably not be changed.
- User interface creates a separate venv occupying more space. Might change in the future.

## Known bugs
- If the bot is waiting for an input (like choosing a song), the bot will stop responding in every server until something is chosen or timeout. This might be fixable, but it's not high priority since the bot is not meant to be used in a lot of servers.

## Command list
You can see aliases for each command using the bot `help` command. If you want to change the name or aliases of a command, search for the command in `bot.py` and replace `name=` and/or `aliases=` with the name/aliases you want.
- `help [command]`: Shows more information about the given command. If no command is provided, shows a list of all commands.
- `play [query]`: The query should be either a URL or what you want to search. If a URL is given, the song plays automatically (it can be a playlist), if not it will let you choose a video. You can also add audio attachments to be played (*only in beta*).
- `fastplay [query]`: Works the same as `play`, but skips having to choose.
- `leave`: Disconnects the bot from the voice channel and clears the song queue.
- `skip`: Skips to the next song, leaves if its the last song (unless loop is enabled). For users without permission, initiates a skip vote.
- `rewind`: Goes back to the previous song.
- `join`: Connects to the voice channel.
- `pause`: Pauses the current song.
- `resume`: Resumes the current song.
- `queue`: Shows the current queue.
- `remove [number]`: Removes the song at position "number" from the queue.
- `goto [number]`: Goes to the song at position "number" in the queue.
- `loop [mode]`: Changes the loop mode (`all/queue` repeats the whole queue, `shuffle/random` randomizes the next song each time, `one` repeats the current song, `autodj` enables autoplay and `off` disables it). If no mode is given, it switches between `all` and `off`.
- `seek [time]`: Goes to the given time, time can be given either in seconds or in HH:MM:SS format.
- `forward [time]`: Fast forwards or rewinds the specified time (depends if the time is positive or negative), time can be given either in seconds or in HH:MM:SS format.
- `volume [volume]`: Changes the volume of the current track, in percentage (from 0.01 to 300%) or dB (from -80 to 9.54dB)
- `shuffle`: Randomizes the order of the songs in the queue.
- `reverse`: Reverses the order of the queue.
- `playlist [mode] [playlist name] [query]`: Manage custom playlists, available modes: `create`, creates the playlist with the given `playlist name`. `names`, to see the playlists created. `add`, to add the query or current song to the playlist. `addqueue`, to add the current queue to the playlist. `remove`, to remove a song from the playlist by its number position (given as `query`). `clear`, to remove all songs from a playlist. `list` to see the songs on a playlist. `play` to add the playlist to the queue. `delete` to delete a playlist. `share` to get a code to share the playlist to other servers (requires bot to be hosted by the same person). `sharecomp`, same as `share` but it works even with different hosts of the bot (as long as they are up to date). `load` to load a code, which can be given in the command itself or by attaching a .txt file (when using `sharecomp` due to the large length of these codes).
- `autodj [query]`: Periodically gets similar songs from whats playing/the query (if given), and ads them to the queue.
- `shazam [duration]`: Tries to recognize the currently playing song and gives info about it. "duration" is the length of the clip to search, default is 15 (in seconds).
- `eq [type] [volume]`: Equalizes the track, types: "bass", "high". Volume in dB, from 0 to 12dB. This will be changed to be more in-depth.
- `bassboost`/`highboost`: Shortcuts for `eq` to boost the bass/high frequencies respectively.
- `nowplaying`: Shows information about the current song (title, artist, duration). **Requires Spotify API**
- `lyrics [song]`: Shows the lyrics of the specified song. If no song is given, it shows the lyrics of the song currently playing. **Requires Spotify and Genius API**
- `chords [song]`: Shows the chords of the specified song. If no song is given, it shows the chords of the song currently playing. Traspose the chords adding `-t [semitones]` to the query (*only in beta*). **Requires Spotify API**
- `songs [number] [artist]`: Shows the top "number" (10 by default) songs from the specified artist. If no artist is given, it will retrieve it from the song currently playing. **Requires Spotify API**

- `search [platform] [query]`: Searches in youtube (by default) or spotify the given query and shows the results. **Requires Spotify API**
- `pitch [semitones] [speed]`: Changes the pitch of the song currently playing (positive for higher pitch, negative for lower pitch). You can also change the speed of the track, by default it will keep the same speed (*only in beta*).
- `nightcore`/`daycore`: Shortcuts for `pitch` to pitch up and speed up/pitch down and slow down the song respectively.
- `download [number]`: Gives a link to download the song currently playing, or the one specified in `number`.
- `steam [user]`: Shows the steam profile of the specified user.

## To be added
A list of things that might get added:
### High priority
Features that would be nice to have right now.
- [ ] Linux/MAC support. (will be difficult to test as i don't have neither).
- [ ] Better looking embeds (alongside more information).
- [X] ~~Favorites (basically "custom playlists" for each server, so that they can easily be called with a single command and not have to add each video or make a yt playlist).~~
- [ ] Stop bot from pausing when selecting a song.
- [ ] DJ Role or similar.

### Medium priority
Features that are not as important, but would be nice to have.
- [ ] Easier command customization.
- [ ] More audio effects.
- [ ] Interactive buttons to play, resume, etc.
- [ ] Certain things to be server-independant (reference messages, search limits for choosing a song, use buttons/reactions, etc).
- [ ] Audio volume normalizer between all tracks (so that they all play at the same perceived volume) and volume normalization for individual tracks (to remove excessive dynamic range).

### Low priority
Features that can wait.
- [ ] Improve the user interface to modify parameters.
- [ ] More info to the `steam` command.
- [ ] More in-depth equalization.
- [ ] Improved readme with more detail on each commands, all aliases, etc.
