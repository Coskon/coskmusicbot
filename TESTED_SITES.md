#### Add to this list
- Info to add: Name of the site/service (additional info, not too long)
- If you had to do zero or minimal changes to the URL to get it to work, add it to the list, if you had to search for a pretty hidden link or directly got the raw data url, don't add it.
- In general, paid services like Netflix, Crunchyroll, HBO, don't work (you might try them anyways, if the video immediately cuts off, it means its private and needs an access token).
